## Bussiness Task
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

## üßº Data Cleaning
[![Go back to Tabe of Contents](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Main_Folder-971901?)](#-table-of-contents)

### üõ† Customer Orders

This is the `pizza_runner.customer_orders` table. As we can see the columns `customer_orders.exclusions` and  `customer_orders.extras` present irregularations in their data wich will cause our analysis to be less accurate.

order_id |	customer_id	|pizza_id	|exclusions	|extras	|order_time|
 ------- | -------------| --------- | --------- | ------| -------- |
1 |	101|	1	|	| |	01/01/2020 18:05
2|	101	|1	||		|01/01/2020 19:00
3|	102	|1	||		|02/01/2020 23:51
3|	102	|2	|	|NULL	|02/01/2020 23:51
4|	103	|1	|4	|	|04/01/2020 13:23
4|	103	|1	|4	|	|04/01/2020 13:23
4|	103	|2	|4	|	|04/01/2020 13:23
5|	104	|1	|null|	1	|08/01/2020 21:00
6|	101	|2	|null|	null	|08/01/2020 21:03
7|	105	|2	|null	|1	|08/01/2020 21:20
8|	102	|1|	null	|null	|09/01/2020 23:54
9|	103	|1|	4|	1, 5	|10/01/2020 11:22
10|	104	|1|	null	|null	|11/01/2020 18:34
10|	104|	1	|2, 6	|1, 4	|11/01/2020 18:34

The columns are plagued with **NULL** values, empty strings '' and 'null' strings. we can also see that multiple ponts are in the exclusions and extras.
First we create a tempt table to handle the missing values before creating the new descriptive tables.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_customer_orders AS 
SELECT
	order_id,
	customer_id, pizza_id,
		CASE 
    -- return empty string if there were no exclusions
    WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR TRIM(exclusions) LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
    WHEN exclusions = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE TRIM(exclusions)
END AS exclusions,

	CASE
        -- return empty string if there were no extras added
		WHEN extras IS NULL or TRIM(extras) LIKE 'null' THEN  NULL
        WHEN extras = '' THEN NULL
	  	ELSE TRIM(extras)
	 END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
````

#### Output
|order_id|	customer_id	|pizza_id|	exclusions	|extras	|order_time|
| ------ | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ----- | -------- | 
|1	|101|	1|NULL	|NULL	|	01/01/2020 18:05 |
|2	|101|	1|NULL	|NULL	|	01/01/2020 19:00|
|3	|102|	1|NULL	|NULL	|	02/01/2020 23:51|
|3	|102|	2|NULL	|NULL	|	02/01/2020 23:51|
|4	|103|	1|	4|NULL	|	04/01/2020 13:23|
|4	|103|	1|	4|NULL	|	04/01/2020 13:23|
|4	|103|	2|	4|NULL	|	04/01/2020 13:23|
|5	|104|	1|NULL	 |	1	|08/01/2020 21:00|
|6	|101|	2|	 NULL|	NULL	|08/01/2020 21:03|
|7	|105|	2|	NULL |	1	|08/01/2020 21:20|
|8	|102|	1|	NULL |	NULL	|09/01/2020 23:54|
|9	|103|	1|	4|	1, 5|	10/01/2020 11:22 |
|10	|104|	1|NULL	 |	NULL	|11/01/2020 18:34| 
|10	|104|	1|	2, 6|	1, 4	|11/01/2020 18:34|

### üõ† Runner Orders

This is the `pizza_runner.runner_orders` table. As we can see the columns `runner_orders.pickup_time`,  `runner_orders.distance` , `runner_orders.duration` and `runner_orders.cancellation` present irregularations in their data wich will cause our analysis to be less accurate.

|order_id|	runner_id|	pickup_time	|distance|	duration|	cancellation|
| ------| ---------- | ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------- |
|1|	1|	01/01/2020 18:15 |	20km|	32 minutes	| |
|2|	1|	01/01/2020 19:10 |	20km|	27 minutes	|
|3|	1|	03/01/2020 00:12 |	13.4km|	20 mins	|NULL|
|4|	2|	04/01/2020 13:53  |	23.4|	40|	NULL|
|5|	3|	08/01/2020 21:10 |	10|	15	|NULL|
|6|	3|	null|	null |	null|	Restaurant Cancellation|
|7|	2|	08/01/2020 21:30	|25km|	25mins	|null|
|8|	2|	10/01/2020 00:15	|23.4 km|	15 minute|	null |
|9|	2|	null|	null|	null|	Customer Cancellation |
|10|	1|	11/01/2020 18:50|	10km|	10minutes|	null|

We create a temporary table and clean the used data.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_runner_orders AS 
SELECT 
	order_id,
	runner_id,
	CASE
        -- Impute with null values
		WHEN pickup_time is NULL THEN NULL
		WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE TRIM(pickup_time)
	END AS pickup_time,
	CASE
        -- Impute with null values
		WHEN distance is NULL THEN NULL
		WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL
		WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
		ELSE TRIM(distance)
	END AS distance,
	CASE 
        -- Impute with null values
		WHEN duration IS NULL THEN NULL
		WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL
		WHEN duration LIKE '%min%' THEN SPLIT_PART(duration, 'min', 1)
        ELSE TRIM(duration)
	END AS duration,
	CASE 
        -- Impute with null values
		WHEN cancellation LIKE '' THEN NULL
		WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN NULL
		WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE TRIM(cancellation)
	END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
````

Then alter the table type.

````sql 
ALTER TABLE temp_runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE TIMESTAMP USING pickup_time::timestamp,
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE FLOAT USING distance::float,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INT USING duration::int;

````
#### Output
|order_id|	runner_id	|pickup_time	|distance | duration |cancellation|
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | --------| ------- | ---------- |
|1	|1	|01/01/2020|	20|	32|	NULL|
|2	|1	|01/01/2020|	20|	27|	NULL|
|3	|1	|03/01/2020|	13.4|	20|	NULL|
|4	|2	|04/01/2020|	23.4|	40|	NULL|
|5	|3	|08/01/2020|	10	|15	|NULL|
|6	|3	|NULL|	NULL|	NULL	|Restaurant Cancellation|
|7	|2	|08/01/2020|	25|	25	   |NULL|
|8	|2	|10/01/2020|	23.4|	15	|NULL|
|9	|2	|NULL	|NULL|	NULL	|Customer Cancellation|
|10|	1|	11/01/2020	|10|	10|	NULL|

Now we are all set to use this temporary tables to answer the solutions from this case study!

	FROM temp_customer_orders AS customer_orders
	INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders runner_orders
	ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
)
SELECT runner_id,
		ROUND(AVG(pickup_minutes), 2) as average_run_minutes

- Runner 1 has an average of 15.68 minutes.
- Runner 2 has an average of 23.72 minutes.
- Runner 3 has an average of 10.47 minutes.

***

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
WITH preparing_time_cte AS (
	SELECT customer_orders.order_id,
	   COUNT(customer_orders.pizza_id) as num_pizzas,
	   --customer_orders.order_time,
	   --runner_orders.pickup_time,
	   runner_orders.pickup_time - customer_orders.order_time as pickup_minutes

	INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders runner_orders
	ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
	GROUP BY customer_orders.order_id, 
	   customer_orders.order_time,
	   runner_orders.pickup_time
	ORDER BY customer_orders.order_id
	)
	
	SELECT num_pizzas,
		   AVG(pickup_minutes) avg_preparing_time
FROM preparing_time_cte
GROUP BY num_pizzas;
````


**Answer:**
| num_pizzas | avg_preparing_time |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 3          | 0:29:17            |
| 2          | 00:18:22.5         |
| 1          | 00:12:21.4         |

- It takes the longest time to prepare 3 pizzas.

***

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

````sql
SELECT customer_orders.customer_id, 
		ROUND(AVG(runner_orders.distance::numeric), 2) avg_distance_km
FROM temp_customer_orders customer_orders
JOIN temp_runner_orders runner_orders
ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
GROUP BY customer_orders.customer_id
ORDER BY avg_distance_km DESC;
````

**Answer:**
| customer_id | avg_distance_km |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 105         | 25.00           |
| 103         | 23.40           |
| 101         | 20.00           |
| 102         | 16.73           |
| 104         | 10.00           |

- Customer 105 has the higuest average distance, which implies this customer is the one the most far away from the pizzeria.
- Customer 104 has the lowest average distance, which implies this customer is the closest to the pizzeria.

***

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

````sql
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) delivery_time_difference_min
FROM temp_runner_orders;
````

**Answer:**
| delivery_time_difference_min |
| ---------------------------- |
| 30                           |

- The range of duration is 30 minutes of all orders.

***

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

````sql
SELECT order_id,
		runner_id,
		duration,
		distance,
		ROUND((distance / duration*60)::numeric,2) avg_kim_per_sec
FROM temp_runner_orders
WHERE (distance / duration * 60) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY runner_id,avg_kim_per_sec;
````

**Answer:**

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

````sql
WITH orders_cte_by_runner_cte AS (
	SELECT RUNNER_ID,
		count(order_id) total_orders,
		count(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS sucessfull_deliveries
	FROM temp_runner_orders
	group by RUNNER_ID)
	
SELECT runner_id,
	ROUND((sucessfull_deliveries / total_orders::numeric) * 100, 2) sucessfull_rate
FROM orders_cte_by_runner_cte;
````

**Answer:**
| runner_id | sucessfull_rate |
| --------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 100.00          |
| 2         | 75.00           |
| 3         | 50.00           |

- Runner 1 has the higuest sucessfull rate at 100 %.
- Runner 2 has a 75 % sucessfull rate.
- Runner 3 has a 50 % sucessfull rate.

Sucessfull rates however are not a reliable metric to score the runners, it could be multiple reasons why an order could not be delivered from bad seasonal weather to a cancellation from either the restaurant or the customer!

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

````sql
WITH meatlovers_toppings_cte AS (
	SELECT  TRIM(unnest(string_to_array(toppings, ',')))::numeric AS topping
	FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes
	WHERE pizza_id = 1),

 vegetarian_toppings_cte AS (
	SELECT  TRIM(unnest(string_to_array(toppings, ',')))::numeric AS topping
	FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes
	WHERE pizza_id = 2)

SELECT meatlovers_toppings_cte.topping 	standard_topping_id, 
	   pizza_toppings.topping_name standard_topping_name
FROM meatlovers_toppings_cte 
INNER JOIN vegetarian_toppings_cte
	ON meatlovers_toppings_cte.topping = vegetarian_toppings_cte.topping
LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pizza_toppings
	ON vegetarian_toppings_cte.topping = pizza_toppings.topping_id;
````

**Answer:**
| standard_topping_id | standard_topping_name |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2                   | Cheese                |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

````sql
WITH toping_list_cte AS (
	SELECT TRIM(unnest(string_to_array(extras, ',')))::numeric AS topping_id
	FROM temp_customer_orders)
SELECT toping_list_cte.topping_id topping_id, pizza_toppings.topping_name topping_name,
		count(toping_list_cte.topping_id) max_topping_count
FROM toping_list_cte
LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pizza_toppings
		ON toping_list_cte.topping_id = pizza_toppings.topping_id
GROUP BY toping_list_cte.topping_id, topping_name
ORDER BY max_topping_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

**Answer:**
| topping_id | topping_name | max_topping_count |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
