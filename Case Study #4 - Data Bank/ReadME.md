## Bussiness Task
anny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isnâ€™t only for banking activities, they also have the worldâ€™s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

## Solutions

## A. Customer Nodes Exploration

### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) unique_nodes
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;
````

**Answer:**
| unique_nodes |
| ------------ |
| 5            |

- There are 5 unique nodes of all branches.

### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?

````sql
SELECT regions.region_name, 
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_nodes.node_id) unique_nodes
FROM data_bank.regions regions
JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes customer_nodes
	ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY regions.region_name;
````

**Answer:**
| region_name  | unique_nodes |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Africa       | 5            |
| America      | 5            |
| Asia         | 5            |
| Australia    | 5            |
| Europe       | 5            |

- All regions have the same number of unique nodes. Very interesting!

### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

````sql
SELECT regions.region_name, 
COUNT(customer_nodes.customer_id) customers_count
FROM data_bank.regions regions
JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes customer_nodes
	ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY regions.region_name
ORDER BY customers_count DESC;
````

**Answer:**

| ------------ | ------------ |
| Australia    | 770          |
| America      | 735          |

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(moving_days)) AS avg_moving_days
FROM reallocation;

````

**Answer:**
| avg_moving_days |
| --------------- |
| 24              |

### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

````sql
WITH customerDates AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    region_id,
    node_id,
    MIN(start_date) AS first_date

FROM reallocation r
JOIN data_bank.regions rg ON r.region_id = rg.region_id
WHERE r.moving_days IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY r.region_id, rg.region_name;
````

**Answer:**
| region_id | region_name |median  |percentile_80 |percentile_95|

## C. Data Allocation Challenge

To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

***

### D. Extra Challenge

Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

    Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!
