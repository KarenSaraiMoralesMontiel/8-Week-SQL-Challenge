## Bussiness Task
anny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isnâ€™t only for banking activities, they also have the worldâ€™s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

## C. Data Allocation Challenge

To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

### D. Extra Challenge

Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

    Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!
